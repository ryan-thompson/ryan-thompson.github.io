    "text": "Hi! I’m a researcher in the School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) in Australia. My scientific interests lie broadly in statistical machine learning. I particularly enjoy working on high-dimensional problems—challenging problems that comprise a large number (thousands or millions) of statistical unknowns. I also like to read widely and follow developments in different fields.\nPrior to joining UTS, I was a postdoc in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of New South Wales, and before that a PhD student in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University. Prior to working in academia, I spent two years consulting financial institutions on quantitative risk management at KPMG. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Sydney.\nMy curriculum vitae is available here.\n\n\n\n\nLast updated: July 19, 2024."
