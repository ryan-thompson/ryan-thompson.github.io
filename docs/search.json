    "text": "Hi! I’m a Research Associate (postdoc) in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, Australia, and a Visiting Scientist in Data61 at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). I’m also a member of the UNSW Data Science Hub.\nMy scientific research interests lie in statistical learning. I particularly enjoy working on high-dimensional problems—challenging problems that comprise a large number (thousands or millions) of statistical unknowns. I also like to read widely and follow developments in different fields.\nPrior to joining UNSW/CSIRO, I was a postgraduate student in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University. Before that, I spent two years consulting financial institutions on quantitative risk management. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Sydney.\nMy curriculum vitae is available here.\n\n\n\n\nLast updated: September 01, 2022."
