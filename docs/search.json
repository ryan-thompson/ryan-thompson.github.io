    "text": "About\n\n\n\n\nI am a Research Fellow at the University of Technology Sydney and a Visiting Scientist at CSIROâ€™s Data61. My research focuses on developing new techniques for machine learning on complex data, with an emphasis on approaches that are statistically principled, computationally scalable, and reliably trustworthy.\nThe main directions of my research can be grouped into a few broad areas of machine learning:\n\nCausal discovery\nUncovering the underlying mechanisms that generate observed data, separating true cause-effect relationships from spurious associations to enable deeper scientific understanding.\nHigh-dimensional learning\nExtracting reliable structure and signal from datasets with thousands or millions of measured variables, where classical statistical principles break down and new techniques are needed.\nBayesian inference\nUsing probabilistic reasoning to integrate prior knowledge with new evidence, yielding transparent measures of uncertainty that guide reliable decision-making.\n\nBefore my current role, I was a Research Associate at the University of New South Wales, following a PhD at Monash University. Earlier in my career, I worked at KPMG, advising financial institutions on quantitative risk management. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Sydney.\nMy curriculum vitae is available here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch\n\n\nScalable subset selection in linear mixed models\nRyan Thompson, Matt Wand, and Joanna Wang\narXiv, 2025\nPreprint - Code\nProDAG: Projected variational inference for directed acyclic graphs\nRyan Thompson, Edwin Bonilla, and Robert Kohn\narXiv, 2025\nPreprint - Code\nSemi-supervised Gaussian mixture modelling with a missing data mechanism in R\nZiyang Lyu, Daniel Ahfock, Ryan Thompson, and Geoffrey McLachlan\nAustralian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics, 2024\nPublication - Preprint - Code\nContextual directed acyclic graphs\nRyan Thompson, Edwin Bonilla, and Robert Kohn\nProceedings of the 27th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, 2024\nPublication - Preprint - Code\nFamilial inference: Tests for hypotheses on a family of centres\nRyan Thompson, Catherine Forbes, Steven MacEachern, and Mario Peruggia\nBiometrika, 2024\nPublication - Preprint - Code\nFlexible global forecast combinations\nRyan Thompson, Yilin Qian, and Andrey Vasnev\nOmega, 2024\nPublication - Preprint - Code\nGroup selection and shrinkage: Structured sparsity for semiparametric additive models\nRyan Thompson and Farshid Vahid\nJournal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 2024\nPublication - Preprint - Code\nThe contextual lasso: Sparse linear models via deep neural networks\nRyan Thompson, Amir Dezfouli, and Robert Kohn\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2023\nPublication - Preprint - Code\nRobust subset selection\nRyan Thompson\nComputational Statistics and Data Analysis, 2022\nPublication - Preprint - Code\nOptimal selection of expert forecasts with integer programming\nDmytro Matsypura, Ryan Thompson, and Andrey Vasnev\nOmega, 2018\nPublication - Preprint\n\n\n\n\nLast updated: September 13, 2025."
