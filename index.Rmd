Hi. I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics](https://www.monash.edu/business/econometrics-and-business-statistics) at Monash University, Australia.

My scientific interests lie in the union of statistics, econometrics, and optimisation. I particularly enjoy developing methods for analysing high-dimensional data, especially where it is relevant to business and economics. I like to read widely and follow developments in different fields.

Prior to joining Monash, I spent two years consulting financial institutions on quantitative risk management. Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Sydney, Australia, where I was most recently an honours student in the Discipline of Business Analytics.
