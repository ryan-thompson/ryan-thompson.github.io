Hi! I'm a researcher in the [School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-science/school-mathematical-and-physical-sciences) at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) in Australia. My scientific interests lie broadly in statistical machine learning. I particularly enjoy working on high-dimensional problems---challenging problems that comprise a large number (thousands or millions) of statistical unknowns. I also like to read widely and follow developments in different fields.

Prior to joining UTS, I was a postdoc in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of New South Wales, and before that a PhD student in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University. Prior to working in academia, I spent two years consulting financial institutions on quantitative risk management at KPMG. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Sydney.

**My curriculum vitae is available [here](resources/RyanThompson_CV.pdf).**
