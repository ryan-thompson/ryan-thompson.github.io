Hi! I'm a Research Associate (postdoc) in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.unsw.edu.au/science/our-schools/maths) at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, Australia, and a Visiting Scientist in the [Analytics and Decision Sciences](https://research.csiro.au/ads/) program at CSIRO's Data61. I'm also a member of the [UNSW Data Science Hub](https://www.unsw.edu.au/research/udash).

My scientific research interests lie in statistical learning. I particularly enjoy working on high-dimensional problems---challenging problems that comprise a large number (thousands or millions) of statistical unknowns. I also like to read widely and follow developments in different fields.

Prior to joining UNSW/CSIRO, I was a postgraduate student in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University. Before that, I spent two years consulting financial institutions on quantitative risk management. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Sydney.

**My curriculum vitae is available [here](resources/RyanThompson_CV.pdf).**
