# About

::: g-col-9

I am a Research Fellow at the [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/) and a Visiting Scientist at [CSIRO's Data61](https://www.csiro.au/en/about/people/business-units/data61). My research focuses on developing new techniques for machine learning on complex data, with an emphasis on approaches that are statistically principled, computationally scalable, and operationally trustworthy.

The main directions of my research fall under a few broad areas of machine learning:

- **Causal discovery**  
Uncovering the underlying mechanisms that generate observed data, separating true cause-and-effect relationships from spurious associations to enable deeper scientific understanding.
- **High-dimensional learning**  
Extracting reliable structure and signal from datasets with thousands or millions of measured variables, where classical statistical principles break down and new techniques are needed.
- **Bayesian inference**  
Using probabilistic reasoning to integrate prior knowledge with new evidence, yielding transparent measures of uncertainty that guide reliable decision-making.

Before my current role, I was a Research Associate at the University of New South Wales, following a PhD at Monash University. Earlier in my career, I worked at KPMG, advising financial institutions on quantitative risk management. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Sydney.
